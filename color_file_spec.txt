------------------------------
	
In the template above:
	<color> is a "#" followed by a six-character hexadecimal number
		It specifies a 24-bit color in RRGGBB format
		The first item in the list above must be a color.
	<fn_type> is one the following:
			first
			second
			linear
			... (more on the way soon).
		At least one function specifier is required. It determines how
		the gradient moves from one color to the next. If there is no
		color after the last function, it uses the first color in the
		list for its second automatically.
	<distance> is an integer
		It represents how many steps in the fractal the gradient will
		use to switch from the previous color to the next. The distance
		takes a minimum value of 1.

The filename is expected to have the ".grad" file extension.
