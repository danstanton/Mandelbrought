Mandelbrought relies on:
  libgmp (gmplib.org)
  libpngwriter (pngwriter.sourceforge.net) 

To build Mandelbrought, just use 'make'.

This creates four executables:
  MBDat (produce a data file corresponding to a view area and resolution)
  MBFind (find the numbers for a zoom region based on a previous image)
  MBImg (apply a coloring to a data file to produce a PNG image)
  MBSeries (produce multiple data files based on a zoom specification)
