Mandelbrought relies on:
  libgmp (gmplib.org)
  libpng (libpng.org)

To build Mandelbrought, just use 'make'.

This creates four executables:
  MBDat (produce a data file corresponding to a view area and resolution)
  MBFind (find the numbers for a zoom region based on a previous image)
  MBImg (apply a coloring to a data file to produce a PNG image)
  MBSeries (produce multiple data files based on a zoom specification)

How to use Mandelbrought (the first time):
  1. Read in_file_spec.txt. This will let you know how to format a
  file that can tell MBDat what to calculate.
  2. Make an input file, e. g. "frac01"
  3. Run "./MBDat frac01" -- This could take a long time depending on
  the zoom level and resolution.
  4. Read color_file_spec.txt. This will le you know how to format a
  file that specifies a gradient.
  5. Make a color gradient file, e. g. "blueorange.grad".
  6. Use the output file from step 3 and the color gradient file to
	create a PNG image like this: "./MBImg frac01.dat blueorange.grad"
  7. You're done! The image should be available as
	"frac01-blueorange.png"
