About
=====

Mandelbrought is a Mandelbrot fractal generator.

Dependencies
============

  libgmp (gmplib.org)
  libpng (libpng.org)

Building
========

To build Mandelbrought, just execute 'make' (www.gnu.org/software/make/).

This creates three executables:
  MBDat (produce a data file corresponding to a view area and resolution)
  MBFind (find the numbers for a zoom region based on a previous image)
  MBImg (apply a coloring to a data file to produce a PNG image)

Use
===

How to use Mandelbrought (the first time):
  1. Read in_file_spec.txt. This will let you know how to format a
  file that can tell MBDat what to calculate.
  2. Make an input file, e. g. "frac01"
  3. Run "./MBDat frac01" -- This could take a long time depending on
  the zoom level and resolution.
  4. Read color_file_spec.txt. This will le you know how to format a
  file that specifies a gradient.
  5. Make a color gradient file, e. g. "blueorange.grad".
  6. Use the output file from step 3 and the color gradient file to
	create a PNG image like this: "./MBImg frac01.dat blueorange.grad"
  7. You're done! The image should be available as
	"frac01-blueorange.png"

Current and Planned Features
============================

Mandelbrought values precision over speed. To this end, it uses the GNU
Multiple Precision Arithmetic library. As a result, this generator is
much slower than others that use the architecture-limited 32 or 64-bit
number representations. I think of this as near-infinite precision.
Currently, this program has no way to represent numbers with more bits
of precision than your computer has bits of memory, and there is no plan to
circumvent this.

Mandelbrought currently stores the entire image dataset in memory. For a
12800x9600 image (wow!), the program uses ~700MB of memory. In the future,
I may add an option to calculate smaller image tiles that are later
stitched together, but this is not a priority for me.

I tried to speed up execution by using a path-finding algorithm to
detect regions of the image that will all be the same color (take the
same number of iterations to escape). I haven't done a lot of
benchmarking, but the speedup I saw was underwhelming (in the
neighborhood of 5%). This is highly dependent on the region of the
Mandelbrot set being calculated, though, and I expect it helps much more
when it detects regions that do not escape since determining that
something does not escape requires calculation of the maximum number
of iterations specified. 

Also, this optimization causes an error when the view area is too large.
The region detection detects the entire outer region as continuous and
does not show the Mandelbrot set at all. I should add some detection for
this with an error message.
  
The first executable produces an intermediate form of the Mandelbrot set
that can have any color scheme applied to it later. This is nice, but it
could be improved by adding a full representation of the final
coordinates of any coordinates that do not escape. Then, if one wanted
to increase the number of iterations used to detect escape a later time,
the entire set would not have to be recalculated. 

Other Things To Do
==================

I would like to add another program to the set that will automate the
process of generating fractals in a zooming sequence. Also, to speed up
this process, I'd like the program to use a quadtree for the
data structure of the set description. In that way, reusing previously
calculated data is natural. Assuming perfect square division of regions
in the quadtree, some numbers would not be representable. As such,
oversampling would be required to produce images that don't look "wrong"
or "flicker" in a video. Later, I'll probably find that some parts of
the quadtree should be discarded or stored to disk as the zoom goes
deeper and memory requirements increase.

I would also like to make an external quadtree data structure that can
provide a more permanent description of the Mandelbrot set. In other
words, an arbitrarily large look-up table could be gradually built to
provide deeper and deeper views into the Mandelbrot set. With that in
place, an interactive view of the Mandelbrot set would be feasible.

I would also like to add another program that provides a better
interface for choosing new points to zoom in on. Currently, the process
of zooming consists of:

1. Write an input specification.
2. Generate the data with MBDat
3. Generate an image with MBImg
4. Find the pixel coordinates for the center of a new image in the GIMP
5. Input the pixel coordinates to MBFind to get a new input spec.
6. Repeat as desired
